### 1. Confirm the Ollama Server is Running
The most likely issue is that your Flask app can't connect to the Ollama server. Even if you ran `ollama serve` and got an error that it's already running, it's possible that the process died or is now stuck.

* **Open Task Manager** (`Ctrl + Shift + Esc`).
* Look for `ollama.exe` in the **Details** tab.
* If it's there, **end the task**.
* Open a **new terminal window** (don't use the one running Flask).
* Run **`ollama serve`**. You should see it start up without any errors. Leave this terminal open.

***

### 2. Restart Your Flask App
Now that you've confirmed Ollama is running, you need to restart your Flask app to re-establish the connection.

* Go to the terminal where Flask is running and press **`Ctrl + C`** to stop it.
* Run **`flask --app app.py run`** again.

***

### 3. Check the Python Code
If the error persists, there might be a problem with the Python code itself, possibly in the `ollama.chat` call.

* **Open `app.py`**.
* Double-check that your `model_name` variable is set to a model you actually have installed, such as `'llama3.2'` or `'codellama'`.
* Ensure that the `ollama.chat()` function is called with the correct parameters: `model`, `messages`, and `stream=True`.

### 4\. Hard Restart Both Services

A hard restart of both the Ollama server and your Flask application can often clear up any stale connections or memory issues.

  * Go to the terminal running **`ollama serve`** and press **`Ctrl + C`** to stop it.
  * Go to the terminal running **`flask --app app.py run`** and press **`Ctrl + C`** to stop it.

\<br\>

  * Restart the **Ollama server first** in a new terminal window:

    ```bash
    ollama serve
    ```

    Wait a few seconds for it to fully load.

  * Then, restart your **Flask app** in a different terminal:

    ```bash
    flask --app app.py run
    ```

### 5\. Check for `ollama.ResponseError`

Your Python code has a `try...except` block that catches `ollama.ResponseError`. This error happens when the Ollama API returns a specific error message.

To see if this is the case, you can temporarily modify your `app.py` to print the exact error message from Ollama instead of a generic "something went wrong" message.

```python
# ... (rest of the code) ...

@app.route('/chat', methods=['POST'])
def chat():
    # ... (rest of the code) ...
    try:
        stream = ollama.chat(
            model=model_name,
            messages=messages,
            stream=True,
        )
        for chunk in stream:
            # ... (rest of the streaming logic) ...

    except ollama.ResponseError as e:
        # This will print the specific error message from Ollama
        print(f"Ollama Response Error: {e.error}") 
        yield f"Error: Ollama API responded with an error: {e.error}"
    except Exception as e:
        # This will catch other unexpected errors
        print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")
        yield f"Error: An unexpected error occurred: {e}"
    finally:
        # ... (rest of the code) ...
```
